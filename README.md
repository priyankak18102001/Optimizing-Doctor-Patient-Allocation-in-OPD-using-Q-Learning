# Optimizing-Doctor-Patient-Allocation-in-OPD-using-Q-Learning
Optimized doctor-patient allocation in OPD using Q-Learning. Simulated the environment as an MDP and trained an agent to minimize patient wait times and improve doctor utilization. Implemented in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib for learning and visualization.
# 🏥 Optimizing Doctor-Patient Allocation in OPD using Q-Learning

This project uses **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)** to optimize doctor allocation in a hospital's Outpatient Department (OPD), aiming to reduce patient waiting time and improve doctor utilization.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Model the doctor-patient scheduling system as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**
- Train an agent using **Q-Learning** to learn the best allocation strategy
- Compare intelligent scheduling with traditional/random methods

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – visualizing the learning process
- **Q-Learning Algorithm** – reinforcement learning strategy
